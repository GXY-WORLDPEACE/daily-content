宿舍舍友对话：
**Scene: A typical college dorm room. Two roommates, Alex and Jamie, are hanging out after classes.**

**Alex:** (walking in and dropping their backpack) Man, today was brutal. That calculus midterm was no joke. How did you do in your classes?

**Jamie:** (sitting on the bed, scrolling through their phone) Ugh, tell me about it. My history lecture was so long today. Professor Thompson just kept going on and on about the Civil War. I swear, I almost fell asleep. But hey, at least it's over. What about you? How was your day besides the midterm?

**Alex:** (grabbing a soda from the mini-fridge) It was okay, I guess. After calculus, I had that creative writing workshop. We had to share our short stories, and honestly, I was so nervous. But everyone liked mine, so that was a relief. Anyway, what are you up to this weekend? Any plans?

**Jamie:** (putting their phone down) Yeah, actually! A bunch of us are thinking about heading to that new coffee shop downtown on Saturday. You know, the one with the live music? Wanna come?

**Alex:** (sitting down on their desk chair) That sounds awesome! I’ve been meaning to check that place out. Plus, I could use a break from all this studying. What kind of music do they usually have?

**Jamie:** (excitedly) Mostly indie stuff, but sometimes they have jazz nights. Speaking of music, have you heard that new album by The Midnight? It’s so good. Perfect for late-night study sessions.

**Alex:** (nodding) Oh yeah, I’ve heard a few tracks. It’s got that cool 80s synth vibe, right? I’ve been more into movie soundtracks lately, though. Like, have you seen "Dune"? The score is insane.

**Jamie:** (leaning forward) Oh my god, yes! Hans Zimmer is a genius. That movie was visually stunning, too. We should totally have a movie night soon. Maybe invite some friends over, order pizza, and binge-watch some classics.     

**Alex:** (smiling) That sounds perfect. We could even make it a theme night—like, all sci-fi or something. Oh, and speaking of dorm life, did you hear about what happened in the common room last night?

**Jamie:** (laughing) You mean when Jake tried to microwave his ramen without water? Yeah, the whole floor smelled like burnt noodles for hours. Classic Jake.

**Alex:** (laughing) I know, right? And then there was that time Sarah tried to make popcorn at 2 a.m. and set off the fire alarm. Good times.

**Jamie:** (grinning) Ah, dorm life. Never a dull moment. But hey, at least we’ve got each other to keep things interesting. So, coffee shop on Saturday, and maybe a movie night next week?

**Alex:** (raising their soda can) Sounds like a plan. Cheers to surviving another week of college chaos.

**Jamie:** (grabbing their own drink and clinking it with Alex’s) Cheers to that! Here’s to more adventures and less burnt ramen.

**Both:** (laughing) Cheers!
